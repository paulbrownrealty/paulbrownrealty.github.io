<h1>Buying</h1>
<p>If you're interested in buying a home, please call me. If there is a particular home you would like to see, I can set an appointment to show it to you. I can also search for homes with the features you want, at prices you're comfortable with, and have the listings emailed to you. We can meet at my office to go over available listings as well. As soon as you find something you'd like to see, I can meet you there and we can take a look.</p>
<p>Right from the start, it is very important to have a plan for how you will pay for your home. The simplest way is to pay cash. However, most people don't have that option and will need to get a mortgage. If you plan on getting a mortgage, you should talk to a lender right away. This way you can find out how much you're qualified to borrow, and you can get an estimate of the initial costs and monthly payments. With this information, you can decide what price range to look in. Also, in order to get an offer accepted, most sellers will require Proof of Funds in the form of a financial statement (if paying cash) or a pre-approval letter (if getting a mortgage). If you don't have a lender in mind, I can give you recommendations.</p>
<p>Once you find a home you're happy with, it's important to make an offer as soon as possible. The longer you wait, the more likely another buyer will see the home and make a competing offer. To estimate the property's market value, I'll perform a CMA (Comparative Market Analysis) by comparing the home with similar properties that have recently sold in the area. When we write the offer, I'll go over financing, inspection or appraisal contingencies, and other terms and conditions we can ask for. I'll let you know what price, terms, and conditions I think you should offer. If the seller counters, I'll let you know if I think you should accept the counter offer, re-counter it, or walk away from the home.</p>
<p>When a seller accepts your offer, you'll be required to make an Earnest Money Deposit (EMD), usually in the amount of $1,000. At the closing, you'll receive the EMD back to use towards your downpayment and closing costs. If you back out of the deal, you could end up losing the EMD. In the contract, I'll make sure there are contingencies to protect you. These contingencies will allow you to back out and keep your EMD if certain conditions are met. You and the seller can usually opt to renegotiate in these conditions.</p>
<p>After you find a home and get an offer accepted, I highly recommend having a private inspection. Even though the home may be inspected by the city and/or an appraiser, neither inspections will be nearly as thorough as a private home inspection. If a physical defect of the property is discovered, you'll have the option to walk away from the deal and get back your EMD.</p>
<p>If you apply for a mortgage, the lender will require an appraisal of the home you wish to buy. A licensed appraiser will estimate the market value of the property. They'll also perform a cursory inspection to determine the habitability of the home. Inspections vary based on the type of mortgage. Inspections for FHA loans are stricter than for Conventional loans. The appraised value may not turn out to be the same amount as the price you agreed to pay the seller. The amount loaned to you is based on whichever number is lower. If the appraisal is lower, you'll be able to back out of the purchase agreement and keep your EMD.</p>
<p>Some cities and townships require an official inspection to be performed whenever a residential building is sold. As a result of the inspection, sometimes the municipality will require that repairs be completed on the property. If a municipal inspection report is available, you can ask the seller to complete any required repairs, you can promise to complete them yourself, or you can ask for something in between. If a report is not available, I recommend asking for a contingency to protect yourself. Once the report comes in, this contingency will allow you to keep your EMD and back out of the deal, based on your opinion of the report.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the seller will have title work prepared for you. The title company will insure that, after closing, no one owns your home except you. If the title company finds that someone besides the seller owns the property, and the seller cannot resolve this, you will be released from the agreement and receive back your EMD.</p>
<p class="bottom">At closing, the money is paid and ownership of the home is transferred. This is when you will pay your down payment and lender fees (if getting a mortgage), or you will pay the full price of the home (if paying cash). You'll also pay the title company for a closing agent, and you might pay for advance property taxes. The closing agent facilitates the closing and processes the funds for you and the seller. Depending on occupancy terms, you may move in as soon as the closing ends or not until a later date.</p>
