<h1>Selling</h1>
<p>If you're interested in selling your home, please call me. We can set an appointment for me to come to your home and provide you with a free CMA (Comparative Market Analysis). To estimate your home's market value, I'll inspect it and compare it with similar properties that have recently sold in the area. I'll also talk to you about the costs involved with selling your home, such as broker commissions, title work, taxes, concessions, and municipal inspections.</p>
<p>If you decide to work with me, I'll enter your home into an MLS (Multiple Listing Service). The MLS will share your home's listing information with local real estate agents. It will also provide information to websites like realtor.com and zillow.com so your home will be marketed directly to buyers.</p>
<p>Some cities and townships require an official inspection to be performed whenever a residential building is sold. I recommend ordering the inspection as soon as the home is listed in the MLS. The more information a buyer has, the more confidence they have to make a better offer on your home. Having a municipal inspection report available gives peace of mind to both you and the buyer. This way, it's easier to come to an agreement at the beginning of the deal, regarding any repairs required by the city or township, instead of potentially having to renegotiate or nullify the transaction right before closing.</p>
<p>Once your home is listed, agents will begin requesting to show your home to potential buyers. Keep your home neat, clean, and free of any unpleasant odors. It's also important to make your home as available as possible for showings. This means allowing showings every day of the week from morning to evening as well as allowing appointments requested with short notice. More showings can result in more offers on your home. Buyers almost always offer more when they know they are competing with other offers.</p>
<p>When we receive an offer, I'll walk you through the terms and conditions. We'll go over the pros and cons of the price, financing, inspection or appraisal contingencies, and other factors. I'll let you know whether I think you should counter, accept, or simply pass on the offer. I'll also let you know what I think you should counter with, if you decide to counter the offer.</p>
<p>In order to close the sale of your home, you'll need to have title work prepared. Title insurance guarantees that no one else owns the property. This assures the buyer that their ownership won't be contested after the closing.</p>
<p class="bottom">At closing, the money is paid and ownership of the home is transferred. This is when you will pay for the title work, taxes, and broker commissions. The title company facilitates the closing and processes the funds for you and the buyer. Depending on occupancy terms, you will need to move out by the day of closing or at a later date.</p>
