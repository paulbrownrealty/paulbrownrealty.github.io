<h1>Expertise in Real Estate</h1>
<p>Hi, there! My name's Paul. I'm a real estate agent.</p>
<p>I set up this website to introduce myself and to tell you about what I have to offer.</p>
<p>A lot goes into a real estate transaction. There's marketing, negotiating, inspections, financing, appraising value, title work, and the list goes on. I represent buyers and sellers to protect their interests. I let them know what they're required to disclose and help them keep their personal information private. I make sure that contingencies are in place so that the people I represent don't wind up stuck in a bad contract that they can't get out of. On behalf of my clients, I negotiate and coordinate with other buyers, sellers, real estate agents, title agents, lenders, appraisers, inspectors, and more. I watch over the different moving parts of the deal to help see that everything is done right and on time. All the while, I keep my clients in the loop and I don't do anything without their approval. I'm there for them from beginning to end and then some.</p>
<p>If you decide to work with me, I'll prepare you for and guide you through this process.</p>
<p>To get a quick overview of what buying a home entails and how I can help you, please check out my <a href="buyingrealestate">section for buyers</a>.</p>
<p>For a brief rundown on the process of selling your home and what I can do for you, please take a look at my <a href="sellingrealestate">section for sellers</a>.</p>
