<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I grew up Downriver and went to school in Wyandotte. I started out at Washington Elementary School and I graduated from Roosevelt High School, class of '98. While at Roosevelt, I marched in the drumline, played on the tennis team, and acted in the theatre. I went off to Eastern Michigan University and graduated in 2005 with a bachelor's degree in history and economics.</p>
<p>In 2013, I received my Michigan Real Estate Salesperson's License. Since then, I have represented clients in over 50 successful transactions. My goal is to provide my clients with the information that will help them find the right home and/or sell their home quickly, always at a great price!</p>
<p class="bottom">If you have any questions or you'd like to schedule an appointment, please call me!</p>
